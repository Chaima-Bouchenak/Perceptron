# Perceptron ~ ML algorithm ~

## Implementation of perceptron algorithm for supervised classification.

### The simple perceptron, 
is the simplest possible neural network. It lacks any hidden layers,
and uses binary threshold as its activation function. it’s good for tasks where we
want to predict if an input belongs in one of two categories, based on it’s features
and the features of inputs that are known to belong to one of those two categories.

### The Multilayers perceptron (MLP),
includes several hidden layers, and allows to produce a non-linear separator. It 
consists of several inputs and outputs. It is a direct propagation network with a 
variable number of artificial neurons, which makes up several layers of the neural system.

## Installation and usage.
This project has 2 dependencies.

**numpy** for the maths implementation and writing the algorithms
**Scikit-learn** for the data generation and testing.
**Matplotlib** for the plotting.
**Pandas** for loading data.
