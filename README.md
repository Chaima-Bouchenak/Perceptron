# Perceptron ~ ML algorithm ~

## Implementation of a simple perceptron for supervised linear classification.
#
## The perceptron is the simplest possible neural network. It lacks any hidden layers,
## and uses binary threshold as its activation function. it’s good for tasks where we
## want to predict if an input belongs in one of two categories, based on it’s features
#3 and the features of inputs that are known to belong to one of those two categories.
